# Notes
A collection of notes for easy reference while self-studying. A mixture of handwritten notes (when I'm not feeling lazy) or notes in the form of markdown extension. Notes written in markdown also serve as markdown practice for me. In the future, I may consider using TeX once I pick it up!

Notes are not really in summary form, and may look very similar to the source material. The idea is that I can (hopefully) learn better by writing/typing the content I have learnt rather than merely reading and absorbing it.
