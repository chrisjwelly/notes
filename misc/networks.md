## Continuous Ping Test
When I was configuring my VPN client, there was a problem where the connection doesn't persist. It will just run for a good minute before failing on me and ocassionally succeeding again. 

A senior assisting me told me to run a continuous ping test to check for packet losses, and to do so we can type in `ping 8.8.8.8` or `ping www.google.com` in the terminal. This will ping to the Google DNS.
